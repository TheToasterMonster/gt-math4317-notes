\section{Problems from Homework 10}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove that the following function is continuous on
  $[-1, 1]$.
  \[h(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n^2} = x + \frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{x^3}{9} + \frac{x^4}{16}\]
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
  Look at the partial sums
  \[S_M = \sum_{n = 1}^M \frac{x^n}{n^2}.\]
  Clearly $S_M$ is continuous. Note that
  \[\left|\frac{x^n}{n^2}\right| \le \frac{1}{n^2}\]
  for all $x \in [-1, 1]$. So by the Weierstrass $M$-test,
  we have
  $S_M \to h(x)$ uniformly on $[-1, 1]$.
  Thus $h(x)$ is continuous since each $S_M$ is continuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $\{x_n\}, \{y_n\}$ be Cauchy sequences. Show that
  $\{x_n + y_n\}, \{x_n y_n\}$ are also Cauchy.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
  Since $\{x_n\}$ and $\{y_n\}$ are Cauchy, we can
  find $N_1$ such that for all $m, n \ge N_1$,
  $|x_m - x_n| < \epsilon$ and $N_2$ such that
  for all $m, n \ge N_2$, $|y_m - y_n| < \epsilon$. Take
  $N = \max\{N_1, N_2\}$. Then for all $m, n \ge N$, we have
  \[|x_m + y_m - (x_n + y_n)| \le |x_m - x_n| + |y_m - y_n| < \epsilon + \epsilon = 2\epsilon.\]
  So $\{x_n + y_n\}$ is Cauchy.

  For $\{x_n y_n\}$, we must first
  observe that Cauchy sequences are bounded, so there
  exist $M_1$ and $M_2$ such that $|x_n| \le M_1$ and
  $|y_n| \le M_2$ for all $n$. So for any $\epsilon > 0$,
  we can pick $N_1$ and $N_2$ such that
  \[
    |x_m - x_n| < \frac{\epsilon}{2M_2}
    \text{ for all $m, n \ge N_1$}
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    |y_m - y_n| < \frac{\epsilon}{2M_1}
    \text{ for all $m, n \ge N_2$}.
  \]
  Then for $m, n \ge N = \max\{N_1, N_2\}$, we have
  \[
    |x_n y_n - x_m y_m|
    = |x_n y_n - x_m y_n + x_m y_n - x_m y_m|
    \le |y_n| |x_n - x_m| + |x_m| |y_n - y_m|
    < M_2 \cdot \frac{\epsilon}{M_2} + M_1 \cdot \frac{\epsilon}{M_1}
    = 2\epsilon.
  \]
  Thus $\{x_n y_n\}$ is also Cauchy.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $K, L$ be two subsets of $\R$. Define
  \[
    d(K, L) = \inf\{|x - y| : x \in K, y \in L\}
  \]
  and suppose that $L \cap K = \varnothing$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item If $K, L$ are compact, then show that
      $d(K, L) > 0$.
    \item If $K, L$ are only closed, then show that it is
      possible to have $d(K, L) = 0$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
  (b)\, Let
  \[K = \left\{n + \frac{1}{n} : n \in \N\right\}, \quad L = \N.\]
  Note that for $x_n = n + \frac{1}{n} \in K$ and $y_n = n \in L$, we have $|x_n - y_n| = \frac{1}{n}$. Then
  we have
  $d(K, L) \le \frac{1}{n}$
  for every $n$, so we conclude $d(K, L) = 0$.

  (a)\, We can find $x_n \in K$ and $y_n \in K$ such that
  \[\lim_{n \to \infty} |x_n - y_n| = d(K, L).\]
  Since both $K$ and $L$ are compact, we can find
  convergent subsequences $\{x_{n_k}\} \subseteq \{x_n\}$
  and $\{y_{n_k}\} \subseteq \{y_n\}$ with
  \[
    \lim_{k \to \infty} x_{n_k} = x_0 \in K, \quad
    \lim_{k \to \infty} y_{n_k} = y_0 \in L.
  \]
  We know that
  \[d(K, L) = \lim_{k \to \infty} |x_{n_k} - y_{n_k}| = |x_0 - y_0|.\]
  Then since $K \cap L = \varnothing$, we must have
  $|x_0 - y_0| > 0$.
\end{proof}
